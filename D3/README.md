# Lab Task D3

## Description

Create program in C++ in OOP structure, splitting it at least into 3 files. 
The class header should be put in header file (program.h).
All the methods should be implemented outside the header – in a special C++ file (program.cpp). 
Function main should be put in yet another C++ file (main.cpp). 
By default, all class fields are private, but class methods - public. 
Unlike previous programs, it is not required to follow specific interface rules regarding repeated execution here (function main can be hard-coded). 
See also other published requirements.

## Lab requirements 

D3. Create class "Date" with three numbers stored - year, month, day. 
The following class methods should be created: 
(1) a constructor to initialize an object with given initial values, 
(2) destructor which should notify about deleting the object, 
(3) method "change" with 3 parameters, 
(4) method "tomorrow" – which calculates and prints the next date, 
(5) method "print", which prints the date.
