# Test Case

## C++ program 

### Examples of use

```commandline
The program checks is given matrix symmetric.

Enter size of square matrix (0 for exit):
-3
The number should be positive or zero.

Enter size of square matrix (0 for exit):
1
Enter 1 numbers representing the square matrix:
7
Is the matrix symmetric by ...
main diagonal: true
side diagonal: true
   horizontal: true
     vertical: true

Enter size of square matrix (0 for exit):
2
Enter 4 numbers representing the square matrix:
0 0 
0 0
