## Study Course Abstract
The goal of the course „Algorithms and Programming” is to provide with the basic knowledge and skills about algorithms, programming and the process of design of computer programs.

Course tasks: mastering basic knowledge and skills of programming in languages C++ and Python; mastering programming skills using structured and object-oriented programming paradigms; mastering the main principles of problem solving with computer programming.
The course is intended for teaching in Latvian and English.
